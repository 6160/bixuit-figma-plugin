## What is it?
This is a plugin for Figma that enables any user to change the copy of your Figma project without directly handling the components. 


## How to install
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/6160/bixuit-figma-plugin/tree/master/builds) and unzip it in the folder you prefer.

Open your Figma desktop app, go to the plugin panel and click on the `+` sign near the `Development` section.
Select the `manifest.json` from the folder you've unzipped early.
Enjoy your new plugin!

## How it works.
The usage is very simple: on the left you can navigate your Pages and Artboards. 
Clicking on an Artboard name will display the preview and all the texts on the right.
Edit your text and then press `ctrl+enter` to commit your changed text to the project. The preview will update accordingly. 


## DISCLAIMER:
This is still an early version, if you find something that isn't working properly please open an issue here on Github
